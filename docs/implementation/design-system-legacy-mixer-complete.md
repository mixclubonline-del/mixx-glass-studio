### Components Using CSS Files (No Migration Needed)

These components use custom CSS files (not Tailwind), so they don't need migration:

- **GlassFader** - Uses `GlassFader.css`
- **GlassPanOrb** - Uses `GlassPanOrb.css`
- **ZMeter3D** - Uses `ZMeter3D.css`
- **WidthLens** - Uses `WidthLens.css`
- **WideGlassConsole** - Uses `WideGlassConsole.css`
- **MicroTrim** - Uses `MicroTrim.css`

These CSS files are pure CSS (not Tailwind), so they're already proprietary and don't need migration.

### Migration Statistics

- **Total Components Migrated**: 7 legacy mixer components
- **Tailwind Classes Removed**: ~50+ instances
- **Design System Utilities Used**: 100+
