## Mixx Club Proprietary Glossary

Living reference for Mixx Club systems, doctrines, and coined terms. Update this file whenever we introduce or evolve domain-specific language.

| Term | Domain | Definition | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reductionist Engineering | Doctrine | Design philosophy: strip any element that does not improve Flow, guidance, or recall. | Canon pillar |
| Flow-Conscious Interface | Doctrine | UI discipline that maintains creator momentum through adaptive behaviors and minimal friction. | Canon pillar |
| Mixx Recall | Doctrine | Personalized memory system that keeps the Studio context-aware on behalf of the creator. | Canon pillar |
| Advanced Leveling System (ALS) | Feedback | Prime feedback channel translating system states into temperature, color, and motion cues. | Canon pillar |
| Bloom Menu | Interaction | Voice-aware, on-demand action surface that stays hidden until summoned. | Canon pillar |
| Prime Fabric | Infrastructure | Internal orchestrator where training, builds, and sealed operations run before artifacts ship to Studio. | Canon pillar |
| Prime Brain Fabric Pipeline | Fabric | Training pipeline housed in `prime-fabric/prime-brain/` that sanitizes Studio state, engineers features, fine-tunes Prime Brain, and exports sealed weights. | Introduced Nov 12, 2025 |
| ALS tone vector | Fabric | Feature vector distilled from ALS channels (temperature, momentum, pressure, harmony) for training prompts and regression checks. | Introduced Nov 12, 2025 |
| Prime Brain Studio Snapshot Loop | Studio | Browser-side exporter that assembles transport, ALS, harmonic, ingest, and Bloom cues every two seconds before sending sealed snapshots to Prime Fabric. | Introduced Nov 12, 2025 |
| Prime Brain Bloom Trace | Studio | Rolling memory of Bloom actions with intent, confidence, and ALS surface routing used to ground Prime Brain training data. | Introduced Nov 12, 2025 |
| Glass Rail Grid | Arrange | Adaptive beat/bar/micro-guide lattice inside the arrange window that tightens with zoom and master-level cues to keep edits locked without numeric HUD. | Introduced Nov 13, 2025 |
| Session Probe | Testing | Dev-only Flow rehearsal overlay that records ALS/Bloom cues with arrange context for rapid user-testing feedback loops. | Introduced Nov 13, 2025 |
| Glass Rail Navigator | Arrange | Bottom overview bar that mirrors total timeline length, enabling drag-to-scroll and marquee zoom while feeding probe telemetry. | Introduced Nov 13, 2025 |
| Zero Lock | Arrange | Zero-crossing assist that snaps clip edges within ±6 ms to prevent clicks; Shift bypasses for freehand edits. | Introduced Nov 13, 2025 |
| Velvet Master Chain | Mastering | Live Five Pillars mastering stack that mirrors the offline Velvet Processor, feeding ALS taps while enforcing profile-aware loudness ceilings. | Introduced Nov 13, 2025 |
| Velvet Compliance HUD | Mastering | ALS overlay that translates LUFS/true-peak telemetry into energy badges so creators feel compliance through color and motion. | Introduced Nov 13, 2025 |
| Translation Matrix | Monitoring | Convolution/EQ monitoring stage with quick-swap profiles (Flat, Car, Club PA, AirPods) and 85/79/74 dB calibration presets for contextual checks. | Introduced Nov 13, 2025 |
| Capture Sanity Check | Recording | Lightweight analyser tagging takes with LUFS, crest factor, and noise-floor notes before Prime Recall ingestion. | Introduced Nov 13, 2025 |
| Flow Welcome Hub | Studio | Entry surface that revives the FLOW mantra, emits ALS/Bloom handshakes, and stores Mixx Recall entry state before the studio runtime boots. | Introduced Nov 13, 2025 |
| Prime Brain Orbitals | Studio | Header-level ALS visualization where temperature, momentum, pressure, and harmony orbit the Velvet lens to broadcast Prime Brain focus without numbers. | Introduced Nov 13, 2025 |
| ALS Health Pulse | Feedback | Prime Brain health glow that fuses CPU load, dropout risk, and doctrine flags into a single color-temperature pulse routed through the Intel Hub. | Introduced Nov 13, 2025 |
| Prime Brain Telemetry Switch | Studio | Bloom Hub setting that toggles Prime Brain snapshot exports between on-device recall and Prime Fabric training streams. | Introduced Nov 13, 2025 |
