## 🎵 **CREATIVE AUDIO CONCEPTS**

### "The Memory" (Narrative)
```
[Ambient music, subtle]

"Every producer has a workflow.
A way they work.
A sound they chase.

But your DAW?
It doesn't remember.

Every session. Same setup. Same struggle.
Like starting from zero. Every time.

Flow remembers.

Prime Brain learns your workflow.
Suggests based on context.
Adapts to your style.

Your studio has a memory now.

Flow.
Where creation meets intelligence."
```

### "The Language" (Poetic)
```
[Music building]

"Other DAWs speak in numbers.
Decibels. Frequencies. Parameters.

Flow speaks in energy.
Color. Temperature. Momentum.

No translation needed.
Just creation.

Flow.
The DAW that speaks your language."
```
