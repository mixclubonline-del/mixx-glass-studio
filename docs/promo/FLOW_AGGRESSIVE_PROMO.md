### Hero (Bold)
```
FLOW
Everything Else is Noise

The DAW built for producers who refuse to compromise.

While others give you 500 plugins and call it a feature,
we built proprietary DSP that actually works.

[Stop Fighting Your Tools] [Get Flow]
```

### Features (Direct)
```
WHAT MAKES FLOW DIFFERENT

🔱 PROPRIETARY DSP
We didn't license someone else's code.
We built our own. Five Pillars architecture.
Because third-party wasn't good enough.

🧠 PRIME BRAIN
AI that remembers your workflow.
Not a chatbot. Not a gimmick.
Your studio's actual memory.

📊 ALS METERING
Feedback that speaks your language.
Color. Temperature. Energy.
Not numbers you have to interpret.

🎨 GLASS INTERFACE
Every pixel earns its place.
No clutter. No confusion.
Just Flow.
```

### Comparison (Brutal Honesty)
```
FLOW vs. THE REST

The Rest:
• Generic plugins from 2015
• Interface designed by committee
• No workflow memory
• Built for "everyone" (read: optimized for no one)
• White backgrounds because... reasons?

Flow:
• Proprietary Five Pillars DSP
• Glass interface that doesn't waste space
• Prime Brain remembers your workflow
• Built specifically for hip-hop
• No white backgrounds. Ever.
```

## 🎵 **AGGRESSIVE AUDIO DEMO**

### Voiceover (Confident, Direct)
```
"Yo, real talk.

You know what every DAW does?
Same plugins. Same workflow. Same limitations.

We said: 'Nah. That's not good enough.'

So we built Flow.

Proprietary DSP. Five Pillars architecture.
Velvet Curve Engine. Harmonic Lattice.

Then we added AI that actually helps.
Prime Brain remembers your workflow.
Suggests moves based on what you actually do.
Stays out your way until you need it.

The interface? Glass. Clean. No clutter.
No numbers. Just color. Temperature. Energy.

This is Flow.

Built for producers who know what they're doing.
Engineered for those who refuse to compromise.

Everything else is noise.

Get in the Flow."
