## Velvet Master Chain (Five Pillars Doctrine)

- **What:** Rebuilt the master buss to mirror the offline Velvet Processor and layered in compliance tooling. The flow is now `Input → Velvet Floor → Harmonic Lattice → Phase Weave → Velvet Curve → Mid/Side Dynamics → Multi-band Velvet Compression → Glue → Velvet Saturator → Compliance Tap → 4× True-Peak Limiter → Dither → Panner → Master Gain`. Live LUFS/true-peak telemetry (ITU-R BS.1770-4) feeds the Velvet Compliance HUD without exposing numbers to creators.
- **Why:** Aligns everyday monitoring with delivery specs—Apple Music (-16 LUFS/-1 dBTP), Spotify (-14/-1), Tidal HiFi (-14/-2), club (-8/-0.8), and Dolby Atmos (-18/-1) profiles are now selectable. Translation Matrix quick-swaps (Flat, Car, Club PA, AirPods) plus 85/79/74 dB calibration presets let us audition context while ALS stays in bloom.
- **Doctrine impact:** Flow via one-touch compliance readouts and recording-mode dock, Reduction by reusing a single Five Pillars implementation (offline + live) and automatically tagging takes with Capture Sanity Check, and Recall through profile-aware trim, Translation Matrix snapshots, and documented validation before export (AES TD1008 / Apple Music 2024 guidance).
