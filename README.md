## 🌟 The AURA Philosophy

> *"Thinking is too slow. You need a tool that anticipates."*

AURA replaces the traditional "record → edit → mix" workflow with a **Flow State** loop, assisted by **Prime Brain**, an always-aware AI companion that understands your creative intent.

### Core Technologies

*   **Velvet Curve Engine**: Psychoacoustic processing that prioritizes "sonic comfort" over raw technical perfection.
*   **Prime Brain**: Context-aware LLM that acts as your co-producer.
*   **Quantum Superposition Engine**: Predictive audio rendering for near-zero latency feel.
*   **Bloom Interface**: Organic, gesture-based UI for flow state maintenance.
*   **ALS (Audio Level System)**: Thermal-based metering that visualizes energy, not just volume.
