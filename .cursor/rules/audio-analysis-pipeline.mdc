# audio-analysis-pipeline

The audio analysis pipeline consists of three major interconnected systems:

## Advanced Leveling System (ALS)
`src/studio/components/ALS/ALSControlPanel.tsx`
- Multi-parameter audio monitoring subsystem
- Real-time analysis of level, peak, RMS, LUFS metrics
- Phase correlation tracking
- Stereo field analysis
- Custom frequency band analyzer with harmonic visualization
Importance Score: 85

## Audio Processing Bridge Layer
`src/components/NativeVelvetCurveBridge.tsx`
`src/components/HarmonicLatticeBridge.tsx`
- Native audio engine integration for core processing
- Harmonic analysis framework for frequency content
- Real-time audio stream processing and routing
- Connects to system audio drivers
Importance Score: 95

## Visualization Pipeline
`src/studio/components/3D/Waveform3D.tsx`
`src/studio/components/3D/ALSVisualizer.tsx`
- 3D waveform generation from audio analysis data
- Frequency spectrum visualization
- Interactive parameter display system
- Real-time updates from ALS metrics
Importance Score: 75

Key Data Flow:
1. Audio input → Native Bridge
2. Bridge → ALS Analysis
3. ALS → 3D Visualization
4. Visualization → User Interface

Overall Pipeline Importance Score: 85/100
