# component-interaction-flow

## Core Data Flow Paths

The system implements three primary interaction bridges for audio processing:

1. HarmonicLatticeBridge
- Handles harmonic analysis data flow between audio engine and UI
- Provides real-time frequency analysis to visualization components
- Connects to PrimeBrainCore for AI-assisted processing

2. NativeVelvetCurveBridge
- Manages bidirectional audio stream between native system and processing layer
- Routes processed audio to ALSVisualizer and Waveform3D components
- Coordinates with AIMixingAssistant for real-time suggestions

3. HushInputBridge
- Controls input monitoring and recording flow
- Integrates with TrackList for multi-track management
- Provides audio metadata to Timeline component

## Context Sharing Architecture

ProjectContext serves as the central state management hub:

1. Audio Processing State
- Shares current audio analysis parameters across ALS components
- Maintains harmonic analysis results for visualization layers
- Coordinates AI processing state with mixing assistant

2. Workflow Context
- Manages BloomMenu adaptive interface states
- Tracks user role and experience level for UI adaptation
- Coordinates between Timeline and TrackList components

## Component Integration Points

The StudioPage acts as the main integration layer:

1. Visual Processing Chain
- ALSVisualizer → PrimeBrainCore → Waveform3D
- Real-time parameter visualization flow
- Synchronized 3D representations of audio characteristics

2. AI Processing Chain
- AIMixingAssistant → TrackList → ALSControlPanel
- Context-aware mixing suggestions
- Cultural adaptation of processing parameters

3. User Interface Flow
- BloomMenu → TopMenuBar → Timeline
- Adaptive workflow optimization
- Dynamic interface updates based on context

Importance Score: 85
