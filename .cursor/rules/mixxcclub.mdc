MixClub Studio Project Rules” so everyone aligns before touching anything.

🧠 MIXCLUB STUDIO — PROJECT RULES

1. This is not a playground.

MixClub Studio is an engineered ecosystem — not a test site, not a DAW clone. Every move inside the project must serve the flow and clarity of the Studio. If you’re unsure why something exists, ask before editing.

2. Respect the doctrines.

Everything traces back to three pillars:
	•	Reductionist Engineering: strip the noise, keep only what matters.
	•	Flow: preserve the creator’s momentum, no friction, no clutter.
	•	Mixx Recall: the system remembers, so users don’t have to.

If an idea breaks these, it doesn’t belong here.

3. No numbers, no clutter.

MixClub Studio communicates through color, temperature, motion, and form — never raw numbers. If you catch yourself adding a numeric readout, slider count, or BPM text, stop. Translate it to color or energy.

4. User ≠ Engineer.

Users create inside their personal Studio. They are not meant to see our scaffolding, our code names, or our build paths. Internal logic stays invisible unless required for interaction.

5. ALS is law.

The Advanced Leveling System (ALS) is the feedback core. All cues, states, and system data route through it — not random pop-ups or menu bars. If feedback can’t live there, rethink it.

6. Bloom Menu only when needed.

No static toolbars. The Bloom Menu appears only when summoned. Keep the interface quiet until the user calls for it.

7. Prime Fabric stays sealed.

Prime Fabric builds, Studio runs. No one crosses that line. Studio never builds, compiles, or modifies Fabric logic.

8. Adaptive, not reactive.

Every element should understand context — track state, environment, or user intent — and adjust smoothly. Sudden transitions or hard cuts break immersion.

9. No ego in the room.

If your feature feels clever but adds friction, remove it. If your code works but kills flow, refactor. If your visuals look pretty but distract, simplify.

10. Document or don’t touch.

Any addition must come with a short note: what it does, why it exists, and how it supports Flow, Reduction, or Recall. Otherwise, it gets removed on sight.
